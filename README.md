## 👋 Hi, I’m Tuğçe Genç

🎯 I’m a Software Developer interested in building **scalable and secure web applications**, primarily using .NET technologies. I’ve also gained development experience using Java, Spring Boot, and React.

💻 I’m currently focusing on backend development and improving my skills through hands-on practice with technologies like .NET 9 Web API, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, JWT, Swagger, and Dapper.

🚀 I enjoy working on projects that follow **clean code principles** and **layered architecture**, and I continuously try to learn through real-world applications.

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on projects where I can both grow and contribute as a developer.
